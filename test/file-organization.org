#+TITLE: The Location of Emacs-Lisp Tests



* The Main Emacs Repository

The Emacs repository contains a very large number of Emacs-Lisp files, many of
which pre-date both formal package support for Emacs and automated unit
testing.

All paths are relative to the Emacs root directory.

** Source

Lisp files are stored in the ~lisp~ directory or its sub-directories.
Sub-directories are in many cases themed after packages (~gnus~, ~org~,
~calc~), related functionality (~net~, ~emacs-lisp~, ~progmodes~) or status
(~obsolete~).

C source is stored in the ~src~ directory, which is flat.

** Test Files

Automated tests should be stored in the ~test/automated/lisp~ directory. Tests
should reflect the directory structure of the source tree; so tests for files
in the ~emacs-lisp~ source directory should reside in the
~test/lisp/emacs-lisp~ directory.

Tests should normally reside in a file with ~-tests~ added to the name of
the tested source file; hence ~ert.el~ is tested in ~ert-tests.el~, or
~pcase.el~ is tested in ~pcase-tests.el~. Exceptionally, tests for a
single feature may be placed into multiple files of any name which are
themselves placed in a directory named after the feature with ~-tests~
appended, such as ~/test/lisp/emacs-lisp/eieio-tests~

Where features of the C source are tested using Emacs-Lisp test files, these
should reside in ~/test/src~ and be named after the C file.

There are also some test materials that cannot be run automatically
(i.e. via ert). These should be placed in ~/test/manual~

** Resource Files

Resource files for tests (containing test data) should reside in a directory
named after the feature with a ~-resources~ suffix, and located in the same
directory as the feature. Hence, the lisp file ~flymake.el~ should have test
files in ~/test/automated/lisp/progmodes/flymake-tests.el~ should reside in a
directory called ~/test/automated/lisp/progmodes/flymake-resources~.

No guidance is given for the organization of resource files inside the
~-resource~ directory; files can be organized at the author's discretion.
